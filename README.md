# üêç Python DSA Practice Repository

Hi! I'm Pooja üë©‚Äçüíª ‚Äî a first-year AIML student currently practicing Python and mastering Data Structures & Algorithms.

This repository contains my daily problem-solving solutions written in Python, covering core logic-building, list operations, 2D arrays, and more.

---

## üöÄ Problem Statements Covered So Far:

1. ‚úÖ **Traverse a 2D array row-wise and column-wise**
2. ‚úÖ **Find all occurrences of a target in a list**
3. ‚úÖ **Print elements greater than the average in a list**
4. ‚úÖ **Advanced list analysis** *(3-in-1)*:
   - First non-repeated element and its index
   - Repeated elements with frequencies
   - Elements at even indices

## üìå Why I'm Doing This:

- To strengthen core Python + DSA skills
- To build a visible track record on GitHub
- To grow confidence with real-world code organization
- Because I love learning and aim to break into product-based internships

### üí° About Me:

- ‚ú® Passionate about AI/ML
- üß† Building problem-solving confidence, one function at a time
- üìà Always open to feedback and learning from the dev community
